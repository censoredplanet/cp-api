# Censored Planet API

This project provides a GraphQL-based API interface for accessing Censored Planet's measurement data stored in ClickHouse. Built with Go, the API enables researchers and developers to programmatically query our comprehensive database of internet censorship measurements collected from vantage points around the world.
The service exposes a flexible GraphQL endpoint that allows users to retrieve censorship data, making it easier to analyze internet freedom trends and conduct research on global connectivity patterns.
